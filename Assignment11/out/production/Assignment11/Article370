Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947[1][2]—allowing it to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[3][4] The government of India revoked this special status in August 2019 through a Presidential Order and the passage of a resolution in Parliament.
